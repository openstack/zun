      .. code-block:: javascript

        "cinder": {

            "autoRemove": false
        }

    To create a volume, set the ``size`` key with its size as value.
    For example:

      .. code-block:: javascript

        "cinder": {
            "size": 1,
            "autoRemove": true

    and redundancy from other availability zones. For instance, if some racks
    in your data center are on a separate power source, you can put containers
    in those racks in their own availability zone. By segregating resources
    into availability zones, you can ensure that your application resources are
    spread across disparate machines to achieve high availability in the event
    of hardware or other failure. You can see the available availability zones
    by calling the ``services`` API.

  type: string
mounts:
  description: |
    A list of dictionary data to specify how volumes are mounted into the
    container. The container will mount the volumes at create time.
    Each item can have an ``type`` attribute that specifies the volume
    type. The supported volume types are ``volume`` or ``bind``. If this
    attribute is not specified, the default is ``volume``.
    To provision a container with pre-existing Cinder volumes bind-mounted,
    specify the UUID or name of the volume in the ``source`` attribute.
    Alternatively, Cinder volumes can be dynamically created. In this case,
    the size of the volume needs to be specified in the ``size`` attribute.
    Another option is to mount a user-provided file into the container.
    In this case, the ``type`` attribute should be 'bind' and
    the content of the file is contained in the ``source`` attribute.
    The volumes will be mounted into the file system of the container and
    the path to mount the volume needs to be specified in the ``destination``
    attribute.

  type: string
nets:
  description: |
    A list of networks for the container. When you do not specify the nets
    parameter, the container attaches to the only network created for the
    current tenant. To provision the container with a NIC for a network,
    specify the UUID or name of the network in the ``network`` attribute.
    To provision the container with a NIC for an already existing port,
    specify the port id or name in the ``port`` attribute.

    If multiple networks are defined, the order in which they appear in the
    container will not necessarily reflect the order in which they are given
    in the request. Users should therefore not depend on device order
    to deduce any information about their network devices.
